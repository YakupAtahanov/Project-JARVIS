"""#195 / #196 — ROOT-direct dispatch scopes the goal, links PIDs, then goes silent.

The direct path (root -> dispatch_execute_tasks -> dispatch_send) must:
  - #196: pass session_id=<active goal id> so the dispatched PIDs link back to the
    goal and every signal turn is goal-scoped (no "No goal found for PID").
  - #195: NOT ask the LLM right after send on the happy path — the tasks' EXIT
    signals drive the next ROOT turn once real results exist. A synchronous send
    error still gets surfaced, because no signal will ever come for it.
