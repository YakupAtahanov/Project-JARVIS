"""
Confirmation Manager — Threat Level Access (TLA) confirmation gate.

MCP server developers declare ``confirmation_required: true`` on tools that
need user approval before execution.  The ConfirmationManager reads that
metadata at dispatch time and gates execution accordingly.

**Non-blocking / event-driven design:**

The manager never ``await``s a user response.  Instead it:

1. Stashes pending tasks with their confirmation id.
2. Sends a notification (desktop / socket / CLI prompt) — fire-and-forget.
3. Returns immediately so the event loop stays free for signals, reminders,
   and new user input.
4. When the user responds, the response arrives as a
   ``CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE`` event through the EventMerger.
5. Jarvis calls ``resolve()`` which returns the stashed tasks and approval
   status, and Jarvis resumes the dispatch.

Three delivery channels, chosen automatically by availability:

1. **Desktop notification** — ``notify-send`` (Linux) with Allow / Deny
   actions.  Skipped when ``notification_silent`` is True.
2. **Socket** — structured JSON on the JARVIS output socket so external
   apps can render their own confirmation UI.
3. **CLI / TTY** — ``[y/N]`` stdin prompt (runs in executor, response
   injected back via EventMerger).

The global ``CONFIRMATION_MODE`` (config) controls overall behaviour:

* ``allow_all``  — skip confirmation, always approve
* ``smart``      — only ask when the tool sets ``confirmation_required``
* ``ask_all``    — ask for every tool call regardless of metadata

**Persistence (#224):**

When constructed with a ``store_path`` the pending list is mirrored to that
JSON file on every mutation (atomic tmp + ``os.replace``) and restored at
construction, so a confirmation survives a daemon restart with its
``created_at`` and ``session_id`` intact and stays resolvable through ``jarvis
confirm``.  Without a ``store_path`` the manager is memory-only and touches no
filesystem at all.
