"""Host-side threat classification for the TLA (Threat Level Access) gate.

The confirmation gate must not let a dangerous tool escape approval simply by
omitting ``confirmation_required`` from its manifest. The *host* assigns a
minimum threat level to a tool based on what it can do — e.g. arbitrary command
execution can escalate via ``sudo`` — and the gate confirms at or above a
threshold. A manifest may RAISE a tool's level (declare it more dangerous, or
opt in via ``confirmation_required``) but can never lower it below the host
floor.

Classification is per TOOL, not per server: a server's dangerous tool
(``run_command``) is gated while its safe siblings (``web_search``) are not.

Beyond tool identity, the *parameters* are scanned for dangerous payloads
(``rm -rf``, ``dd if=``, ``| sh`` …): a host-safe tool handed a destructive
argument is raised too. This is raise-only and complements the identity floor;
it never lowers a level (Project-JARVIS #162).

The four tiers mirror the kernel policy engine's vocabulary so the userspace
gate and the OS embodiment speak the same language.
