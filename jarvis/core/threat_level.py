"""Host-side threat classification for the TLA (Threat Level Access) gate.

The confirmation gate must not let a dangerous tool escape approval simply by
omitting ``confirmation_required`` from its manifest. The *host* assigns a
minimum threat level to a tool based on what it can do — e.g. arbitrary command
execution can escalate via ``sudo`` — and the gate confirms at or above a
threshold. A manifest may RAISE a tool's level (declare it more dangerous, or
opt in via ``confirmation_required``) but can never lower it below the host
floor.

Classification is per TOOL, not per server: a server's dangerous tool
(``run_command``) is gated while its safe siblings (``web_search``) are not.

Beyond tool identity, the *parameters* are scanned for dangerous payloads
(``rm -rf``, ``dd if=``, ``| sh`` …): a host-safe tool handed a destructive
argument is raised too. This is raise-only and complements the identity floor;
it never lowers a level (Project-JARVIS #162).

The fourth input is the *registry tier* (#223): the dispatch path stamps the
server's install-time trust tier (``registry_tier``) and whether the local
manifest declares this tool (``registry_declared``) into the metadata, and a
tool floors at ELEVATED unless its declaration passed the registry's gate —
tier ``official``/``community`` AND manifest-declared. A server nobody
reviewed (URL install, unreadable manifest, legacy tier vocabulary) cannot
lower itself below ELEVATED by self-declaring ``safe``. Metadata WITHOUT the
``registry_tier`` key is out-of-dispatch context and gets no tier floor, so
bare-metadata callers keep their contract. Raise-only like every other input.

The fifth input is the *privileged-command* floor (#208): each platform's
``privileged_prefixes()`` (``pacman``, ``systemctl stop``, ``useradd``, …) is
scanned against the params the same way the payload patterns are. It exists
for the gap the other floors miss — a tool with a command-ish parameter but a
name outside ``HOST_DANGEROUS_TOOLS`` (so the identity floor stays SAFE) whose
argument doesn't match the payload regexes (``sudo``, ``rm -rf``, …) either.
Under the dmcp scope model, elevation itself is decided by scope, not by
inspecting the command — so this floor is TLA signal only, not a mechanism.
Raise-only, to ELEVATED.

The four ThreatLevel tiers mirror the kernel policy engine's vocabulary so
the userspace gate and the OS embodiment speak the same language.
