"""
GoalManager — tracks what the user actually wants, in a tree.

Each user message produces a root Goal. The dispatch sub-chain can create
child Goals (sub-goals) under it as planning recurses. Leaf goals hold
task_pids linked to real MCP dispatch tasks; inner goals aggregate their
children's outputs.

Key concepts:
  description — the intent, set at creation, never changes
  strategy    — forward-looking mutable state written by the LLM
                ("plan is X, currently doing Y")
  output      — backward-looking final result written when the goal
                completes ("built the backend: Postgres on :5432, …")
                This bubbles up: a parent sees each child's output.

Completed and failed goals are archived to a JSONL file so the contextor
can reference past accomplishments and failures.
